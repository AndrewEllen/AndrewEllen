# Hi, I'm Andrew

I'm a software developer from Scotland who primarily works with **Flutter** and **Python**. I focus on building reliable, privacy-conscious apps with clear structure and practical design.

My main project is **NutriMotion**, a health and fitness app built around tracking your **diet, fluid intake, outdoor cardio with GPS, weights, and more**. It’s designed to give people real tools to get in shape and stay in shape without the fads or gimmicks that usually come with fitness tracking.

## What I do

I build complete systems that connect solid frontends with dependable infrastructure. Most of my work is in **Flutter** and **Python**, but I work across the stack from mobile to backend and deployment.

* **Nginx** configuration for routing, reverse proxying, and SSL setup
* **Cloudflare** DNS management and domain configuration
* **Firebase** for authentication, storage, realtime data, and cloud functions
* **Python** for backend services, automation, and data processing
* **React** with **TypeScript** for web dashboards and companion tools
* **Website development** from design to hosting and deployment
* **Mobile development** with Flutter including GPS tracking, background sync, and offline 

I have experience with **Nginx** configuration, **Cloudflare** DNS management, and setting up domains, SSL, and routing. I work with **Firebase**, **Cloud Functions**, and **Python** services to handle automation, data processing, and realtime updates. I use **React** with **TypeScript** for web dashboards and admin tools, and I develop and host full websites from initial design through deployment.

On the mobile side I design and maintain production apps focused on reliability and performance, including realtime data handling, GPS tracking, background sync, and offline capability. I focus on structure, clarity, and long term maintainability so that the code stays stable and easy to work with as the project grows.
